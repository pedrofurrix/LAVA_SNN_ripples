    Extreme cases:
    1. When the output neuron does not spike when it should have spiked.
    2. When the output neuron spikes when it should not have spiked.
    In such cases, the spike time instead of being set to the final time step, is set to: final time step * penalty_factor.

    The first spike time of each output neuron [batch_size x num_outputs] is
    measured against the desired spike time with the Mean Square Error Loss
    Function.


    Note that the derivative of each spike time with respect to the spike
    df/dU is non-differentiable for most neuron classes, and is set to a sign
    estimator of -1.
    I.e., increasing membrane potential causes a proportionately earlier
    firing time.

    The Mean Square Error Temporal Loss can account for multiple spikes by
    setting ``multi_spike=True``.
    If the actual spike time is close enough to the target spike time within
    a given tolerance, e.g., ``tolerance = 5`` time steps, then it does not
    contribute to the loss.import torch.nn as nn

    Index labels are passed as the target by default.
    To enable passing in the spike time(s) for output neuron(s), set
    ``target_is_time=True``.

    Note: After spike times with specified targets, no penalty is applied
    for subsequent spiking.
    To eliminate later spikes, an additional target should be applied.

    Example::

        import torch
        import snntorch.functional as SF

        # default takes in idx labels as targets
        # correct classes aimed to fire by default at t=0, incorrect at t=-1
        (final time step)
        loss_fn = mse_temporal_loss()
        loss = loss_fn(spk_out, targets)

        # as above, but correct class fire @ t=5, incorrect at t=100 with a
